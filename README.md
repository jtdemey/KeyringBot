# KeyringBot 
A Discord bot that saves users' public encryption keys on a server-wide basis so others on the server can request them with a simple command.

## Commands

-	**!kbdelete**		Removes your saved public key
-	**!kbget**			Requests the public key for the given Discord username
-	**!kbhelp**			Displays this message
-	**!kbping**			Replies with "pong!"
-	**!kbsave**			Saves your public key so others can request it. If the public key exceeds Discord's 2000 character limit, an attached text file with the ASCII-encoded key is required.
